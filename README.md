**Reflection Questions**

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**

I break user needs down into smaller, simple steps so I know exactly what I’m building. It helps me stay focused on what actually matters instead of getting caught up in stuff that doesn’t. I try to think about how someone would actually use the program day-to-day.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I like to take things one piece at a time instead of trying to build everything all at once. Using Agile stuff like sprints, user stories, and retrospectives makes it way easier to stay organized and catch problems early. I definitely want to keep working like that going forward.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

It means being someone the team can count on. Getting your work done, communicating, and helping out when people need it. It’s not just about finishing your own stuff, it’s about making sure the whole team does well. That’s what I try to focus on.
