Reflection Questions

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
I look at what the user actually needs and break it down into smaller steps or user stories. It helps me stay focused on what matters most instead of overcomplicating things.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I like to work on projects in smaller pieces instead of trying to do everything at once. Using Agile ideas like sprints, user stories, and retrospectives makes it easier to stay organized and fix problems as they come up.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It’s about communicating, being reliable, helping out when needed, and keeping the team’s goals in mind, not just your own work.
